The sun was shining brightly in the clear blue sky.
A small cat sat quietly under a big tree.
It watched the birds flying from branch to branch.
A little girl walked by with a red balloon.
She smiled when she saw the cute cat.
The cat softly meowed and wagged its tail.
It was a warm and happy afternoon.
