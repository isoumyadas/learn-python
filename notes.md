# python notes

## virtual env

    - When you have two projects, and want same package with different versions, then venv helps.
    - It creates the virtaul env, where you can install the packages with that specific verison and you can use that directly into your code.
    - command to create a venv :
      - You can do that using ctrl+shift+P -> create virtual env -> select python version.
      - In terminal
        - `python -m venv .venv` & `source .venv/bin/activate` [Remember to put exact path what you've named your venv folder]
          - To check if venv is activated:
            - `which python` || `which pip`
        - And to deactivate `deactivate`
        - And it should be active:
          - If it doesn't show any .venv on terminal you can kill that terminal and open new.
          - You can view that right hand side of your vscode right below to your terminal written 3.12.3 (.venv) if its there, then you can continue to install the packages.
          - If you can't then click on that version and then select the .venv.
    - Same for this we have anaconda for managing python distributions and virtual env on your machine
    - Very popular, in Data Science.

## Packages

    - pip install is used to install the dependencies.
    - To upgrade the pip inside venv
      - `pip install --upgrade pip`

## Python inner working

    - hello.py (program file) => byte code (generated by python, mostly hidden) => fetched by ->  python virtual machine

    1. Compile to Byte Code:
       1. What is byte code
             1. A low-level, intermediate code that is generated when source code (human-readable programming language) is compiled.
       2. Low level code -> [ programming languages with little to no abstraction from a computer's physical hardware, operating very close to the processor ]
       3. Platfrom independent (Cloud, any OS)
       4. Byte code runs faster. (comparatively to script it runs faster)
       5. .pyc is compiled python (frozen binaries) [ They act as a cache, saving time by skipping the recompilation of code from .py to bytecode. ]
       6. __pycache__ => importance as python. learn more about this
          1. hello.cpython-312.pyc
             1. source change : It uses some diffing algo, it watches the old now and compare with new code and change only neccessary fields.
             2. cpython-312 : is python version
             3. .pyc : is frozen binaries
          2. This .pyc only works for imported files.
          3. Not for top level files (no imported dependencies)
    2. Python VM
       1. Code loop to iterate byte code
       2. It's Run Time Engine
       3. Also known as python interpreter.
    3. Byte Code is NOT machine code
       1. Machine code is direct instruction to your chip/hardware (intel, apple)
       2. Byte code is Python specific interpretation.
          1. You can't run this byte code on JAVA VM.
       3. cpython (standard implementation), jython, IronPython, Stackless, PyPy

##

## strings

    - You can use both "name" & 'name'

## Identation is important in python

    - other programming languages use {} python use identation
      ```js
      - if score > 90
        - print("A grade")
      - else
        - print ("B grade")
      ```

    - In PEP8
      - Using 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
      - Naming conventions like user_name not userName
      - Where to put spaces around operators
